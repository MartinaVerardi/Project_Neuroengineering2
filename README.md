<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is based on the paper: <br>
```ANDROWIS, Ghaith J., et al. Electromyography assessment during gait in a robotic exoskeleton for acute stroke. Frontiers in neurology, 2018, 9: 630.``` which can be found [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00630/full)

There has been calculated the BDSI and the iEMG indexes.

### Built With

this project has been entirely made in [MATLAB](https://it.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* You should have a FindStep function (see  paper ```GANDOLLA, Marta, et al. Automatic setting procedure for exoskeleton-assisted overground gait: proof of concept on stroke population. Frontiers in neurorobotics, 2018, 12: 10.``` [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2018.00010/full)).
* You should have/built a [TKEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945630/) function.
* You should have some EMG data.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Add FindStep and TIKEO
3. Run the code
